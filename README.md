# ReEntry
ReEntry is an app dedicated to providing re-entry resources for previously incarcerated individuals. Using the user's location, we're suggesting nearby resources they can access, including local community colleges, mental health resources, and homeless shelters. We are also going to implement a job search API where users can find jobs that accept workers with a criminal history.
